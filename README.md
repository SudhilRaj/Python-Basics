# Python-Basics

* Install Python: Download and install Python from the official Python website (https://www.python.org). LTS - 3.11.3

* We can execute a python file by entering the following command:
	python file.py

* Installing python will install all the necessary dependencies for python along with the python package manager called 'pip'.
	- pip is a package management system and command-line tool for installing, managing, and distributing Python 	packages. It is the standard package installer 	for Python and is widely used in the Python community.
	- The name "pip" is recursive and stands for "Pip Installs Packages" or "Pip Installs Python." It simplifies the process of installing and managing third-party 	libraries and packages that extend the functionality of Python.
	- Some key features and functionalities of pip include:
	1) Package Installation: pip allows you to install Python packages from the Python Package Index (PyPI) or other package repositories. You can install packages 	using the command pip install <package-name>.
	2) Package Management: pip provides commands to manage installed packages, such as listing installed packages (pip list), upgrading packages (pip install --	upgrade <package-name>), and uninstalling packages (pip uninstall <package-name>).
	3) Dependency Resolution: pip automatically resolves and installs dependencies required by a package during installation. It ensures that all the necessary 	dependencies are installed to run a particular package or application.
	4) Package Distribution: pip allows developers to package and distribute their own Python libraries and applications. It provides commands to create 	distribution packages (e.g., source distributions or wheels) and upload them to PyPI or other package repositories.
	5) Virtual Environments: pip works seamlessly with Python virtual environments, which are isolated environments that allow you to install packages and manage 	dependencies separately for different projects.
	6) Requirements Files: pip supports the use of requirements files, which are text files listing the exact versions of packages required for a project. You can 	create a requirements file and use pip to install all the packages specified in that file at once.
	7) Integration with Build Systems: pip can be integrated into build systems or development workflows, allowing for automated package installations and updates 	during software development.

* This repo contains basic concepts and examples. The example files also have necessary explanations.
